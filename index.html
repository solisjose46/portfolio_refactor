    <h2 class="text-gutter">About</h2>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Background</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. I enlisted in the US Army immediately after
      graduating high school.
      After completing my enlistment, I studied computer science at Foothill Community College where I earned my
      associate degree. During my last year at Foothill, I also participated in a cybersecurity program where I earned
      three cybersecurity certificates. Currently, I am a software engineering student at Arizona State University and
      intern as software engineer at Comtech Telecommunications. Also, I am part of Synack Red Team where I freelance
      bug bounty.</p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Programming Journey and Education</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">My first exposure to programming was in my high school year biology class when creating a
      presentation using HTML and CSS. However, I was also interested in mathematics and physics, so I started my
      college education as a mechanical engineering major. Prior to starting college, I enlisted in the US Army. During
      my final deployment to Afghanistan, I was self-teaching myself Java during my downtime. Once I was in college,
      along being enrolled in classes that are shared among most STEM majors, such as calculus and physics, I enrolled
      in an intro computer science course. This introductory course introduced to me basic programming concepts in C++,
      and it influenced me to switch majors to computer science.</p>

    <p class="text-gutter">After my first year of college, I was invited to study at Stanford University for the summer.
      At Stanford, I took a course focusing in client side programming which was really an intense JavaScript course.
      After my summer at
      Stanford, I resumed my studies at Foothill College; I completed my associate degree in computer science at
      Foothill College. All of my computer science coursework was completed in C++. During my final year at Foothill
      College, I met a Navy veteran who introduced me to SANS Institute's veteran scholarship which allows former
      servicemembers to earn up to three cybersecuirty certificates. Because of my interest in cybersecuirty and limited
      knowledge of it, I participated in the program earning three certificates. Earning my final certificate, web
      application penetration testing, earned me an invitation to join Synack Red Team. Synack Red Team is essentially
      an invite only bug bounty program. After completing my associates and earning three cybersecuirty certificates, I
      transferred to the University of California, Santa Cruz to complete my bachelors in computer science. Because of
      the COVID pandemic, I moved home to Phoenix to study remote; however, I was not satisfied with the program at
      UCSC. I really enjoyed the courses I was taking such as relational databases but the courses core to the program
      were too theoretical for my liking. I do not blame the school for this. It is COMPUTER SCIENCE after all, but I
      did crave something much more practical. My transfer to Arizona State University to their software engineering
      program was the perfect fit I was looking for. My favorite course at Arizona State University so far has been
      Operating Systems.</p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Personal Education</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">I continue to grow through freelancing, free online resources and personal projects. My
      invitation to Synack Red
      Team allows me to collect bug bounties on my free time which helps me develop my web application penetration
      skills. I say develop rather than maintain because the truth is I am nothing like a Mr. Robot type hackerman. I
      use this platform as a learning tool mostly rather than a reliable source of income. I augment this
      with Hack The Box and watching walkthroughs from the awesome IppSec. I am interested in the cybersecurity field
      but I am mostly do this because it really has helped me understand the bigger picture.</p>

    <p class="text-gutter">Some of my projects include developing LAMP application or developing a game. Each project
      has a point to it. The
      LAMP project I created helped me understand how to handle authentication and the role of databases in a web
      application. My projects don’t focus just on development. I have IT related projects too like turning my old
      gaming desktop into a personal laboratory. I installed Proxmox on it and run several virtual machines. One running
      an Apache Web Server, another running MySQL and another acting as a client.</p>

    <p class="text-gutter">At the moment, I am self teaching myself Go programming for web development.</p>

    <h2 class="text-gutter">Work Experience</h2>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Softpoint</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">My first internship was at a company located in Scottsdale, Arizona called Softpoint which
      does business in
      payment processing mostly for food, hospitality and entertainment businesses. My internship was a three month
      opportunity with the option to extend, but I decided not to extend and move on.</p>

    <p class="text-gutter">At Softpoint, I was immediately placed to work on Android development. The majority of my
      time there was to work
      on a refactor of their flagship software. I was given the task to comb through their source code and identify code
      which was deprecated and implement modern solutions. During this process, I learned to be very familiar with
      reading documentation. For example, one of my earliest tasks was to implement dependency injection via Hilt
      framework. I spent most of my time reading documentation and completing short codelabs. This enabled me to become
      very familiar with the framework and complete my task. After, I was able to give a summary to some of the
      full-time developers on how it works and how to implement it.</p>

    <p class="text-gutter">I learned alot about Android development in my short time at Softpoint. I learned about
      design patterns such as
      MVVM and actually implementing them with modern solutions. I learned to work with SDKs because Softpoint’s
      software needed to support a range of Android based hardware. I learned to use Git in a commercial environment. I
      have used Git for personal and school work, but it requires more knowledge to use properly in a collaborative
      environment. Received hands on experience working with JSON and troubleshooting network requests. This is not an
      exhaustive list but hopefully it gives an idea on how much I learned in a short amount of time.</p>

    <h3 class="text-gutter">Comtech Telecommunications</h3>

    <p class="text-gutter">I started this internship right after completing my internship at Softpoint. For both
      internships, I worked
      part-time while going to school full-time. I am currently still working at Comtech located in Tempe, Arizona, so I
      will update this section at the conclusion of my internship. For now, I will talk about the greatest differences
      between my internship experiences.</p>

    <p class="text-gutter">The IT environment is the greatest difference. It is a Microsoft environment. Because of
      this, I believe it
      influenced the choice of stack for the project I am currently working on. Prior to this, I have experience with
      languages and frameworks that are more accessible such as Java, PHP and MySQl. At Comtech, everything I work with
      is a Microsoft product. From the IDE I develop C# code on to the server that the application I develop for is
      hosted on. Also, unlike my previous internship, I am expected to support and develop for both client and server. I
      write cshtml daily. The SQL queries I produce are meant for MSSQL, and I test them in SQL Server Management
      Studio. I use powershell to run scripts. Oddly enough we aren’t using TypeScript but I believe this will change
      soon.</p>
